/**
 * Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) is a way of measuring how likely your employees are to recommend your organization as a good place to work.
 * It asks one simple question: "On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend [company name] as a place to work?"
 *
 * Responses to the eNPS 0 - 10 satisfaction scale are graded into three categories:
 *
 * - Promoters (9 - 10): The most satisfied employees, happy and motivated
 * - Passives   (7 - 8): These employees are content enough, but not passionate about the business
 * - Detractors (0 - 6): Dissatisfied employees who wouldn't recommend the company
 *
 * To calculate your company eNPS, first remove the Passives. Subtract the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters, and round
 * it to the nearest whole number.
 *
 * - %Promoters â€“ %Detractors = eNPS
 * - (Promoters / (Promoters + Passives + Detractors) * 100) - (Detractors / (Promoters + Passives + Detractors) * 100) = eNPS
 * - (Promoters - Detractors) / (Promoters + Passives + Detractors) * 100 = eNPS
 *
 * Thus, a company with 60% Promoters and 15% Detractors gives a score of 45.
 *
 * eNPS scores can, theoretically, range from +100 (every employee is a Promoter and you have the perfect company) to -100 (every employee is a
 * Detractor and your company is in trouble), with anything above 0 being an acceptable score.
 *
 * A good eNPS score is between 10 and 30; above 30 is excellent.
